Carbon Footprint Web App for HumaniTech Hackathon

Our hack is a tool that allows you to look at your carbon footprint and allows you to compare your footprint with the average American's footprint. It uses regularly updated data from the EPA and gives you a national and global sense of the problem.

There are three pages on this website:
    a. Carbon emission calculator - allows you to enter inputs and determines your footprint. It uses Bootstrap formatting and sends data to another page. 
    b. Used Google Maps API and jquery to show relative color-coded CO2 emission rates by state in the United States. 
    c. Used an array to get data of CO2 emssion from different countries and automaticaly calculate the percentage differece in CO2 emissions.
